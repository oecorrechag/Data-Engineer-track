-- ## 0.3.3 Practice with aggregate functions

-- ### Query the sum of film durations
-- SELECT SUM(duration) AS total_duration
-- FROM films;

-- ### Query the sum of film durations
-- SELECT avg(duration) AS average_duration
-- FROM films;

-- ### Find the latest release_year
-- SELECT MAX(release_year) AS latest_year
-- FROM films;

-- ### Find the duration of the shortest film
-- SELECT MIN(duration) AS shortest_film
-- FROM films;


-- ## 0.3.5 Combining aggregate functions with WHERE

-- ### Calculate the sum of gross from the year 2000 or later
-- SELECT SUM(gross) AS total_gross
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year >= 2000;

-- ### Calculate the average gross of films that start with A
-- SELECT AVG(gross) AS avg_gross_A
-- FROM films
-- WHERE title LIKE 'A%';

-- ### Calculate the lowest gross film in 1994
-- SELECT MIN(gross) AS lowest_gross
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year = 1994;

-- ### Calculate the highest gross film released between 2000-2012
-- SELECT MAX(gross) AS highest_gross
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year
--     BETWEEN 2000 AND 2012;


-- ## 0.3.6 Using ROUND()

-- ### Round the average number of facebook_likes to one decimal place
-- SELECT ROUND(AVG(facebook_likes),1) AS avg_facebook_likes
-- FROM reviews;

-- ### Calculate the average budget rounded to the thousands
-- SELECT ROUND(AVG(budget),-3) AS avg_budget_thousands
-- FROM films;


-- ## 0.3.9 Aliasing with functions

-- ### Calculate the title and duration_hours from films
-- SELECT title, (duration/60.0) AS duration_hours
-- FROM films;

-- ### Calculate the percentage of people who are no longer alive
-- SELECT COUNT(deathdate) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS percentage_dead
-- FROM people;

-- ### Find the number of decades in the films table
-- SELECT (MAX(release_year) - MIN(release_year)) / 10.0 AS number_of_decades
-- FROM films;


-- ## 0.3.10 Rounding results

-- ### Round duration_hours to two decimal places
-- SELECT title, ROUND(duration / 60.0,2) AS duration_hours
-- FROM films;
